	No diff on BookOnTape.reader : has been removed from both local and remote copies.
	No diff on Periodical.title : it has been removed in right, but its container (Periodical) has been entirely removed from left.
	
	No equivalences.
	
	Conflicts on :
	1 and 15 : Not a generic conflict, relies on ecore-specific business rules : enum literals of the same enum with the same 'value'.
	8 and 18 : the remote Magazine is a subclass of the locally deleted Periodical
	12 and 27 : remote renaming of a locally deleted attribute
	14 and 28 : renaming to different values
