	No diff on BookOnTape.reader : has been removed from both local and remote copies.
	No diff on Periodical.title : it has been removed in right, but its container (Periodical) has been entirely removed from left.
	
	No equivalences.
	
	Conflicts on :
	1 and 10 : enum literals of the same enum with the same 'value'
	5 and 13 : the remote Magazine is a subclass of the locally deleted Periodical
	7 and 20 : remote renaming of a locally deleted attribute
	9 and 21 : renaming to different values
