== Project names and location ==

'''Project names should match their location'''

=== Cause ===

If you need to compare models that:
* reference another model in the same project (or another project which also meets the following point), and
* are located in a project which name (as seen in their '.project' file) does not match their containing folder's name (case sensitive).

Due to [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=354801 Bug 354801], we cannot properly support models that are located in Eclipse projects which identifier is distinct from their containing folder, case included. For example, if you have a project named ''EcoreModels'', it '''must''' be contained in a folder named ''EcoreModels''. Any other name, even if changing only the case, such as ''ecoreModels'', will cause issues when comparing fragmented models (or any model which references another).

Note that this only applies to comparisons launched from within Eclipse, which would trigger the opening of the EMF Compare user interface.

=== Observed Symptoms ===

Symptoms vary, but they often include a NullPointerException somewhere in EMFSynchronizationModel such as :

 Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
 at org.eclipse.emf.compare.ide.ui.logical.RevisionedURIConverter.<init>(RevisionedURIConverter.java:108)
 at org.eclipse.emf.compare.ide.ui.logical.EMFSynchronizationModel.resolveTraversal(EMFSynchronizationModel.java:464)

 at org.eclipse.emf.compare.ide.ui.internal.structuremergeviewer.EMFCompareStructureMergeViewer.compareInputChanged(EMFCompareStructureMergeViewer.java:258)

== Models out of the workspace ==

'''The models should be imported within the workspace'''

=== Cause ===

Trying to compare models that are not present in the current Eclipse workspace from either the ''Git repositories'' perspective, or from the ''Git Staging'' view.

Note that this only applies to comparisons launched from within Eclipse, which would trigger the opening of the EMF Compare user interface.

=== Observed Symptoms ===

Symptoms are mostly the same here as they would be with the limitation mentionned above regarding project names, and they usually include the same NullPointerException:

 Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
