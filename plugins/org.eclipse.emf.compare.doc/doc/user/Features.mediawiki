== Grouping Differences  ==

This feature allows you to group differences together in the structural view according to a set predicate. By default, EMF Compare provides three distinct grouping strategies :

; Default : Do not try and group differences together, display them as they were detected.

; By Kind : Group differences by their kind (''additions'', ''deletions'', ''moves'', ''changes'').

; By Side : Group differences according to their side: left or right and a special group regrouping differences in conflicts with other differences together.

PENDING : New grouping strategies can be provided to EMF Compare through extension points.

== Filtering Differences  ==

This features allows you to filter differences out of the structural view according to a set predicate. By default, EMF Compare provides five distinct filters :

[[Image:./../images/EMF_Compare_Filters_Choice.png]]

; Pseudo conflicts differences : Filter out all pseudo conflicts differences(only in 3-way comparison). Enabled by default.
; Identical elements : Filter out all identical elements (elements with no differences). Enabled by default.
; Empty Resource Mappings : Filter out all resource mappings with no differences from the view. Enabled by default.
; Cascading differences : Filter out all differences that are contained under differences (except when in conflict). Enabled by default.

PENDING : New filters can be provided to EMF Compare through extension points.

== Text Attribute Comparison  ==

Differences made into ''String''-typed attributes can be compared and merged directly as text from the compare interface through a simple right-click on the difference.

== Graphical Comparison  ==

PENDING UPDATE

Since the 1.2 release EMF compare provides the ability to compare models with graphical modelers. 

Have a look on the following demos :

[[http://www.eclipse.org/emf/compare/doc/features/videos/EcoreTools-v2/EMFCompareEcoreTools.html | Demo : Comparing Ecore files with diagrams]] 

[[http://www.eclipse.org/emf/compare/doc/features/videos/Papyrus/EMFComparePapyrus.html | Demo : Comparing UML files with diagrams]]

== Logical Model  ==

EMF Compare does not act simply on the selected files, but on their whole logical model (a given model can be split through multiple files through EMF ''control'' action). Thanks to that, if you try and compare a model file that reference other model files, the comparison will still be able to take these "other" files into account. For example, if you try and compare a ''genmodel'' file (that depends on its underlying ''ecore'' file) :

EMF Compare will actually consider both files when comparing :
