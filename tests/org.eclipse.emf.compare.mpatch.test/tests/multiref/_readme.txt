This model is structured as follows:

Entitiy Container
  + Entity A
  + Entity B
  + Entity C

The differences (multiref.mpatch) describe the adding of a new Entity x which contains reference to all three sub-entities.
These references' targets are again all three entities.
That is, three Entities should be added including references to each of the entity.
