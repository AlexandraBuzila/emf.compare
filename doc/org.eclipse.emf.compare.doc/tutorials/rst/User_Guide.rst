Installation
============

To install EMF Compare you'll need to use either the EMFT update-site :  <http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/updates/>`_ 
or the build bits from the download page  : <http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/downloads/?project=compare>`_

Requirements
------------
EMF Compare depends on:
#. EMF runtime
#. Eclipse Platform (if you don't want to run EMF Compare in "standalone mode".

 

Configuration
=============

Activating EMF Compare on a given file extension
-------------------------------------------------

EMF compare uses a content-type to know whether it should be used for comparison. This content-type will initially register itself against .ecore and .uml files. 
You may add your own extension using the Preferences view / Global / Content-types and adding your file extension in the "EMF Compare" content-type.
