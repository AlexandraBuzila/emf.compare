About the transformation:

The transformation has originally been specified in QVT Operational Mappings:
org.eclipse.emf.compare.mpatch.emfdiff2mpatch/transform/emfdiff2mpatch.qvto

However, the dependency to the qvt engine is crucial because it is by default not contained in the Eclipse Modeling Edition.
Therefore we re-wrote the transformation in pure Java:
org.eclipse.emf.compare.mpatch.emfdiff2mpatch.impl.Emfdiff2Mpatch

These two transformations work exactly identical with the following notes:
- The Java version is about 1.5-2x faster (still, it is a lot faster than the preceding difference calculation by EMF Compare!)
- The qvto version is much more readable because a lot of overhead is done automatically (e.g. creation of objects)
- The distinction of all the DiffElements is much more elegant in qvto

Because of understandability and readability reasons we keep the original transformation, too.
